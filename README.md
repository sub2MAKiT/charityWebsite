# charityWebsite
The front end to the charity website

## Description of the goal

Right now it is just a simple pie chart, just as an example of how that could be achieved but... okay, I'll level with ya.

I'm absolutely garbage at web design, and even though I can take care of the backend pretty well, the front end is not my forte, so I'll need some help with that one.

If you'd like to contribute by adding more funcionality (making it possible to sort the donations/picking certain time ranges), MAKiNG it look nicer (css, js for the pie chart or just more general design choices) or just clean up garbage code (considering how I started the project, there is a lot of garbage to clean up) I would really appreciate it.

If you'd like to join the project, you can contact me on [discord](discord.gg/TSEBQvsWBr)

# Description of the data

In the html code, example **sortedDonationsByAmount** data is provided to make up the chart, below it the [exampleData.json](./sites/exampleData.json) there are the unsorted and unparsed donations.

The goal of the website is to display this data in as interesting and as curious of a way as possible + enourage people to donate to charity.
